# Directory synchronization
The program performs one-way synchronization between source and replica directory. Synchronization is performed periodically based on the provided time interval. The program leverages the BLAKE2 hash algorithm known for its performance advantages over MD5 and SHA-2 Furthermore, it employs multiprocessing to parallelize the hashing computations, enhancing efficiency.
